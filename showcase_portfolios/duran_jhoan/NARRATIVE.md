# Jhoan Duran - The Splinker

## The Unhittable Splitter and Why It's Nearly Impossible to Hit

### The Hardest Splitter in Baseball

Jhoan Duran's "splinker" - a splitter thrown harder than most pitchers' fastballs - represents one of baseball's most devastating weapons.

**Key Metrics:**
- 4-Seam Fastball: 100.4 MPH average (elite velocity)
- Splitter: 94.0 MPH average (HARDEST IN MLB)
- Velocity difference: Only 6.5 MPH
- Vertical movement difference: 18.0 inches
- Usage: Splitter is his primary pitch (50.3%)

### Why It's Unhittable

The combination of elite velocity (94.0 MPH) and sharp downward movement creates an optical illusion. Batters see a fastball coming at them at 100+ MPH, commit to swing, and the ball drops out of the zone at the last moment.
