# Tarik Skubal - The Tunnel Master

## Why Skubal's Fastball-Slider Combo Won Him the Cy Young

### The Perfect Tunnel

Tarik Skubal's 2024 AL Cy Young award was built on one of the most devastating pitch combinations in baseball: his fastball-slider tunnel.

**Key Metrics:**
- 4-Seam Fastball: 96.5 MPH average
- Slider: 86.0 MPH average (10.5 MPH difference)
- Release point consistency: 1.7 inches apart
- Combined usage: 94.8% of all pitches

### Most Effective Sequence (vs RHH)

**4-Seam Fastball → Changeup**
- Usage: 18 times
- Whiff Rate: 40.0%
- Chase Rate: 50.0%

### The Secret: Tunneling

Both pitches come from nearly identical release points, making it impossible for batters to distinguish them until it's too late. The fastball appears to rise into the top of the zone, while the slider drops sharply down and away.
